# Hella-Social
Our group wanted to create a place where people could connect and make friends based on common interests. We realized that once adulthood began, it was a lot harder to make new friends... and awkward to try! Using Hella-Social, users can select their interests and access messageboards to talk about their hobbies. 

# Getting Started
As a new user, create an account and select interests to save to the user profile. 

As a returning user, selected interests will automatically display on the homepage as different tabs. When the user clicks each tab, a messageboard for that interest will be displayed and the user can participate in a conversation in that board.
