<h1> Hella-Social<h1>
<h3>A Social Media platform tailored for the San Franciosco Bay Area which matches users according to common interests and allows them to interact.<h3>


<h2>Inspiration:</h2>
<h4>Our group wanted to create a place where people could connect and make friends based on common interests. We realized that once adulthood began, it was a lot harder to make new friends... and awkward to try! Using Hella-Social, users can select their interests and access messageboards to talk about their hobbies and even plan events. <p>

<h2>Getting Started:</h2>
As a new user, create an account and select interests to save to the user profile, you will then be directed to message boards regarding your interests.
As a returning user, selected interests will automatically display on the homepage as different tabs. When the user clicks each tab, a messageboard for that interest will be displayed and the user can participate in a conversation in that board. 

<h2>Built with:</h2>
MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, Bootstrap, jQuery, javaScript, HTML, CSS
