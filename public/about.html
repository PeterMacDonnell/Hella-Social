        <div class = "body">
        <p>Welcome to Hella Social! A hella social place tailored for the San Franciosco Bay Area where people can
            connect and make friends based on common interests. We realized that once adulthood began, it was a lot
            harder to make new friends... and awkward to try!</p>

        <p>Using Hella-Social, users can select their interests and access messageboards to talk about their hobbies
            and even plan events! As a new user, create an account and select interests to save to the user profile,
            you will then be directed to message boards regarding your interests. Here you can connect with other
            users, read previous posts and plan events and meetups.</p>

        <p>As a returning user, selected interests will automatically display on the homepage as different tabs. When
            the user clicks each tab, a messageboard for that interest will be displayed and the user can participate
            in a conversation on that board. </p>
